This little application demonstrates LSH (Locality Sensitive Hashing) with min hashing to find (near) similar texts. Currently the application downloads rss feeds from the web and extracts the description to group near similar documents. The application makes use of the Spring framework to provide database functionality for the rss sources. 

The algothimic concept of this application is explained in chapter 3:  Anand Rajaraman and Jeffrey David Ullman. 2011. Mining of Massive Datasets. Cambridge University Press, New York, NY, USA. There is also a online lecture https://www.coursera.org/course/mmds I strongly recommend anyone, who considers learning more about natural language processing, data mining or big data in general, to view the videos and do the exercises.
